# liquid-simulation
by Diego Sahid García Galván

## A final project for the "Physical Experimentation and Statistical Thinking" course at ITESM

We were asked to build a simulation of the experimental device called "Mariotte's Bottle" with the knowledge about parabolic motion and magnitude calculation acquired during the course.

This simulation of emptying a bottle uses concepts such as Torricelli's theorem, for calculating the exit velocity and the formula of parabolic motion, specifically starting from the maximum height.

Our simulation starts by pressing the space bar and will show the exit velocity of the liquid that is poured through each of the three holes in the container.
